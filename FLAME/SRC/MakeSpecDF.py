# Loop over each line 'i' and then over each spectrum 'j' within line 'i'.

# Wavelength (for the index) and radiance to a new dataframe (temp2).
# For all subsequent spectra, append the new dataframe with a radiance
# column. The results in a new dataframe 'outpanel' that has a wavelength
# column (also set as the index), plus all the radiances in subsequent
