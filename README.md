# DEA-CalVal-Phase2

This repo contains workflows that are relevant to the DEA Calibration/Validation
project, utilising new UAS (Unmanned Aerial System, aka drone) technology to
conduct field campaigns, starting in March 2020.

The drone-mounted hardware includes the

Flame UV-VIS spectrometer

and the

Spectral Evolution SR-3500

.<P>

The FLAME directory includes calibration data that were independently measured by

in the CALIBRATION directory. Output csv files are stored in the CSV directory.
The MISC directory contains miscellaneous information, including image
registration python scripts based on

, which can be used to check the relative positioning (ie. registration) of
drone- and satellite-based imagery. Output png files can be found in the PNG
directory. Source code for the workflows is found in the SRC directory.
Flame workflows are found in the WORKFLOWS directory. <P>

The SR3500 directory contains the SR3500 raw data, workflows and outputs,
sorted into field campaign days. It is likely that this will be reformatted
once a method for phase 2 field campaigns is fully nailed down. <P>
